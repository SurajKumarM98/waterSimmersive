        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The overall purpose for the WaterSIMmersive project is to help
          community members from diverse areas and backgrounds, many of whom
          have been historically under-represented in key discussions, better
          understand their water systems; this includes understanding where
          their water comes from, how it is used, who relies on its supply, and
          how adjudication efforts can play a role in establishing water
          security. We are hoping that the exhibits we develop with communities
          across the state will inform STEM learning about natural resource
          management and equip multi-generational community members with the
          knowledge they need to make decisions to protect the health and
          well-being of their communities for generations

                  ASU's grant team is working with rural and tribal communities
                  to collect water stories and evaluate exhibits using a
                  transactional UX design process: Empathize, Define, Ideate,
                  Prototype, and Test. In the Empathize stage, rural and
                  American Indian students will collect 15–20 stories per site,
                  guided by Drs. Hale and Lauer, with participants receiving $50
                  Amazon gift cards. Stories will be stored using TheirStory
                  software, managed by Labriola. Game development will draw from
                  the We Are Water project and water perception surveys,
                  including the Walton Water and Climate Survey (2020), the
                  American Public Media Water Main Survey (2018), and White et
                  al. (2019). The Define stage will involve coding data and
                  creating visitor personas, with an interface designer and
                  programmer hired for game development. The Ideate phase will
                  focus on brainstorming game flow, scripts, and exhibit content
                  for the museum exhibit in Page, AZ.
