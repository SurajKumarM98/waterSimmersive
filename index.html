        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The overall purpose for the WaterSIMmersive project is to help
          community members from diverse areas and backgrounds, many of whom
          have been historically under-represented in key discussions, better
          understand their water systems; this includes understanding where
          their water comes from, how it is used, who relies on its supply, and
          how adjudication efforts can play a role in establishing water
          security. We are hoping that the exhibits we develop with communities
          across the state will inform STEM learning about natural resource
          management and equip multi-generational community members with the
          knowledge they need to make decisions to protect the health and
          well-being of their communities for generations

                <p>
                  ASU's grant team is working with rural and tribal communities
                  to collect water stories and evaluate exhibits using a
                  transactional UX design process: Empathize, Define, Ideate,
                  Prototype, and Test. In the Empathize stage, rural and
                  American Indian students will collect 15–20 stories per site,
                  guided by Drs. Hale and Lauer, with participants receiving $50
                  Amazon gift cards. Stories will be stored using TheirStory
                  software, managed by Labriola. Game development will draw from
                  the We Are Water project and water perception surveys,
                  including the Walton Water and Climate Survey (2020), the
                  American Public Media Water Main Survey (2018), and White et
                  al. (2019). The Define stage will involve coding data and
                  creating visitor personas, with an interface designer and
                  programmer hired for game development. The Ideate phase will
                  focus on brainstorming game flow, scripts, and exhibit content
                  for the museum exhibit in Page, AZ.

                  The Prototype stage will begin year two and involve sketching,
                  wireframing, and prototyping gameplay. We will Test basic
                  usability issues of the prototypes in a lab environment and at
                  sites around ASU (e.g. ASU's Night of the Open Door, which
                  invites community members to visit ASU campuses and learn
                  about the projects being developed there), and will continue
                  to improve the designs before deploying the game to our first
                  major host site, the Arizona Science Center, in the latter
                  half of the year. We will continue to iterate on the design,
                  content, and flow of the surrounding exhibit panels. Dr. Lauer
                  will run experiments on data visualization comprehension to
                  refine the style and delivery of visualized data in both the
                  game and exhibit. We will begin pilot testing at the exhibit
                  we set up at the Arizona Science Center and will finalize and
                  polish up the WaterSIMmersive game for expanded deployment in
                  year three. We will develop a project website to showcase
                  collected stories and other drought-related content. We will
                  work with host tribal and rural communities to develop
                  programming and supplementary material to accompany exhibit
                  deployment.

                  In year three we will deploy exhibits to a pair of sites in
                  the East region of Arizona for one four-month span (Bullion
                  Cultural Center and Museum in Miami-Globe and the Fort Apache
                  Heritage Museum on the White Mountain Apache Reservation)
                  followed by a second pair of sites in the West region of
                  Arizona for another four-month span (Lake Havasu History
                  Museum and the Colorado River Tribal Museum). We will travel
                  to the communities to open and close the exhibits and
                  facilitate community programming and museum-based research. We
                  will run quasi-experimental pilot studies. Iterative
                  development of K-20 supplemental educational materials will be
                  informed by a half-day workshop we host with teachers from
                  rural and tribal communities.

                <h3>Title #1</h3>
                <p>
                  ASU's grant team is working with rural and tribal communities
                  to collect water stories and evaluate exhibits using a
                  transactional UX design process: Empathize, Define, Ideate,
                  Prototype, and Test. In the Empathize stage, rural and
                  American Indian students will collect 15–20 stories per site,
                  guided by Drs. Hale and Lauer, with participants receiving $50
                  Amazon gift cards. Stories will be stored using TheirStory
                  software, managed by Labriola. Game development will draw from
                  the We Are Water project and water perception surveys,
                  including the Walton Water and Climate Survey (2020), the
                  American Public Media Water Main Survey (2018), and White et
                  al. (2019). The Define stage will involve coding data and
                  creating visitor personas, with an interface designer and
                  programmer hired for game development. The Ideate phase will
                  focus on brainstorming game flow, scripts, and exhibit content
                  for the museum exhibit in Page, AZ.

          The overall purpose for the WaterSIMmersive project is to help
          community members from diverse areas and backgrounds, many of whom
          have been historically under-represented in key discussions, better
          understand their water systems; this includes understanding where
          their water comes from, how it is used, who relies on its supply, and
          how adjudication efforts can play a role in establishing water
          security. We are hoping that the exhibits we develop with
